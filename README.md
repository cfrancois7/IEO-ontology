# IEO-ontology
The Industrial Ecology Ontology(IEO): the ontology to represent the knowledge of the Industrial Ecology. The IEO ontology is a realistic ontology based on the [BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) to represent the knowledge about the natural and technological processes as well as the model such as the different items of the life cycle assessment (LCA), the Supply-Use Tables (SUT) and the Input-Output Tables (IOT). It inclused many other ontologies: [RO](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations), [IAO](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO), [OBI](https://github.com/obi-ontology/obi), [STATO](https://github.com/ISA-tools/stato), [ENVO](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo), [SGDIO](https://github.com/SDG-InterfaceOntology/sdgio), etc.

The early development of the IEO was sponsored by [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php) and initialized by [Cyril François](https://isterre.fr/auteur/cyril-francois).
